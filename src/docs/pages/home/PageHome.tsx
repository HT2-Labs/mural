      <P>As awesome as it would be to have a 100% dependable system, that always offers exactly
        what you need, reality dictates otherwise. A lot of 'planning ahead' goes into the
        components in Mural but this doesn't mean that they are fool proof. We will never catch
        all possible use cases. If you are wanting to use a component in a curtain way but the
        component is lacking functionality, let us know! We can have a chat about it and find a
        solution, be it changing components or adding new ones.</P>
